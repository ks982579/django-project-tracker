### Cookies
> It is now set that the csrftoken cookies should be placed in the browser
and React should be able to retrieve them. 

### Auth-Context
> Created AuthContext and wrapped the App component. 

### Authentication
> User is able to log in and out. A 'sessionid' token is saved and deleted from the browser. Managing state based on loggin status!

> Once logged in, the 'ProjectCard' component is rendered which should/will show the user's current projects.
